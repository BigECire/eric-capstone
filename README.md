## Motivation:
I enjoy fiction, especially science fiction and fantasy, and usually enjoy the movies that are made from some of my favorite authors like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Frank Herbert.  There are other authors that I enjoy reading but have not enjoyed the movies that were made from the books such as Rick Riordan’s work.  I also wanted to see if it is past time for a movie to be made from a book. 

## Questions:
1) Is a book’s rating on GoodReads an indicator of whether a movie made from the book would also get a good rating on IMDb?
2) Is there a time limit for a book to be made into a movie?
3) Did some directors fare better at making a movie from a book then others, and therefore, could that be a predictor of how the movie would be rated?
4) Is there a trend where some authors’ books made better films?

## Problems and Hurdles
Finding source material was the first challenge.  After finding a comprehensive list of books that had been made into films, it was difficult to connect those films and books to their titles in other sources to get their ratings.  The books were especially challenging since books can come out in many different editions while all being the same book.  

## Technologies Used
1) Python / Pandas - for exploration, cleaning and making visualizations of the dataset
2) Power Point - for creating a presentation
3) Git - for version control

## Data Sources
To answer the above questions, I used the following information from the following sources for my analysis.

1) Wikipedia was used to web-scrape the lists of works of fiction made into feature films

2) A dataset of books scrapped from Goodreads done by Zygmuntz

3) A set of noncommercial datasets provided by IMDb along with scrapping more specific information from those movie’s webpages on IMDb

## Conclusion
Movies based on books tend to use books that have higher ratings.  Whether that correlates to higher ratings for the movies is weaker since more factors contribute. 

When looking at the directors, experience does help.  Directors that chose to work on films that are based on proven authors, have a greater likelihood of producing a movie that has a positive rating.  However, even for skilled director it appears hard for them to make a movie that exceeds the rating of the book.

While the time between publication and release of a movie does not appear to be a factor, for authors it is clear that it is becoming a shorter turn-around time.  Movies are less often being made on books that were published more than 5 years ago.  It would appear that the film industry thinks that it has used most of the good books from the past.
